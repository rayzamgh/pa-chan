1. **Set up a Google Cloud account**: If you haven't already, sign up for a Google Cloud account and create a new project. You can follow the instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects

2. **Install Google Cloud SDK**: Install the Google Cloud SDK on your computer by following the instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

3. **Authenticate with Google Cloud**: Run the following command to authenticate your account and set the active project:

```
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
```

Replace `[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]` with the ID of the project you created in step 1.

4. **Create a GCS bucket**: Create a new GCS bucket to store your app's files. Replace `[BUCKET_NAME]` with a unique name for your bucket.

```
gsutil mb gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
```

5. **Build your React app**: Navigate to your React app's directory and build the production version of your app:

```
npm run build
```

or

```
yarn build
```

This will generate a `build` folder containing the optimized production build of your app.

6. **Upload your React app to GCS**: Upload the contents of the `build` folder to your GCS bucket:

```
gsutil -m cp -r build/* gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
```

7. **Make your bucket publicly accessible**: Run the following command to make your bucket's contents publicly accessible:

```
gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
```

8. **Configure the bucket as a static website**: Set the main page and the 404 page for your GCS bucket:

```
gsutil web set -m index.html -e index.html gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
```

9. **Update the bucket's CORS configuration**: Create a `cors.json` file with the following contents:

```json
[
  {
    "origin": ["*"],
    "responseHeader": ["Content-Type"],
    "method": ["GET"],
    "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

Then, run the following command to update your bucket's CORS configuration:

```
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
```

10. **Access your React app**: Your React app is now deployed on GCS, and you can access it via the following URL:

```
http://[BUCKET_NAME].storage.googleapis.com
```

Replace `[BUCKET_NAME]` with the name of your bucket. You can also set up a custom domain for your app by following the instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website

Remember to keep your Google Cloud SDK and the `gsutil` tool up-to-date to ensure compatibility and access to the latest features.
